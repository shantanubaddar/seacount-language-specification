"Everything Is An Array"

Seacount was born from a very specific place: the sheer frustration of working with arrays in general-purpose languages like C, C++, and Java. (As a second-year student, I've felt this pain firsthand.)

These languages can do anything, but that versatility comes at a cost. Array operations—the thing I needed most—were always complicated, verbose, and slow to write. The old adage, "Jack of all trades, master of none," fits perfectly.

So, I started designing Seacount. This isn't another general-purpose language. It's a language that eats, sleeps, and breathes arrays. Now, I know there are other array languages out there, but let's be honest: beginners tell scary stories around campfires about their cryptic syntax and steep learning curves.

My goal is different. I'll start with the basics of how Seacount works, and in later chapters, I'll introduce the unique features I believe are necessary for modern array programming.

Let's start by looking at a basic Seacount file:


@getall.scntbase

@start main() {
    rat array = {1, 2, 3.56, 2.12, 8};
    array.chdep(float, int, double);
    rat array_2 = {3, 2.4, 8.1, 6, 3.2};
    array = array + array_2;
    print(rat, array);

    @empty(*arrays).confirm();
}


A lot of questions probably jumped into your mind. What is rat? What does chdep do? Why @empty(*arrays).confirm()? Don't worry—I'll explain it all.

· @getall.scntbase is how you import Seacount's standard library, pulling in all the basic functions you'll need.
· Programs begin execution in the @start main() function. The @ symbol flags keywords for the interpreter, making parsing more straightforward.
· I deliberately kept the syntax—curly braces {}, semicolons ;—familiar to C-style languages. I didn't want to create something completely alien, especially for a project that might only be used by five people in the world once a year.

And there you have it! The basic structure of a Seacount file, which uses the .scnt extension.

This covers the absolute basics. In the next chapter, we'll dive into the heart of Seacount: the rat array.
